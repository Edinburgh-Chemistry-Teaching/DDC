## Unit 08 Learning Objectives

This is the first of two Units focussing on applying the learned material for chemistry-related problems. In this Unit you will:

- look at the real mass spectrometry data for some interesting molecules, visualise the structures, plot the data and find the peaks.
- learn about carbon isotopes, their stability and radioactive decay, and how we can use it to calculate the age of a given sample.
- make a Quiz, that could even be helpful for you to learn periodic table.

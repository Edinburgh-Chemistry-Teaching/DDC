    "**Mass Spectrometry (MS)** is an experimental technique enabling the *measurement of the mass-to-charge (m/z) of a molecule*. In a mass spectrometer, molecules can also be fragmented: as such, the mass-to-charge of resulting fragments can also be simultaneously detected. A typical mass spectrum is reported in a dataset with two columns: the first is a regularly spaced range of m/z values, while the second is the detected intensity associated with each m/z value. In this first application, we will work with MS data of some fun molecules!"

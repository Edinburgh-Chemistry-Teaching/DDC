    "`plot_icsd` is intended to take a data file with the same format as `V_containing_ICSD.csv`, and produce a histogram based on the CellVolume column values. In addition, it takes two arguments (`groupby_col` and `group_ranges`) which should cause it to create a stacked histogram based on data in another column. For example, if `groupby_col = Temperature` then `plot_icsd` should produce a plot where histograms for different temperature ranges are stacked on top of each other. The ranges to use are defined by the `group_ranges` argument, which is a list containing the temperature divisions. These ranges should be exclusive of the upper value, but inclusive of the lower value, i.e.\n",

    "    > Hint: to generate an certain number of bins across a range, use `np.linspace(start, end, number_of_bins+1)` (remember that computing a histogram requires both left and right edges of each bin, but plotting only requires the left edge)\n",

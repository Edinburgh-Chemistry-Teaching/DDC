# # 1. Recap of ultraviolet visible spectroscopy
# <a id='1-recap-of-ultraviolet-visible-spectroscopy'></a>
# In this section you will learn how to analyse data you have collected with a UV-vis spectrometer such as [this one](https://www.agilent.com/en/product/molecular-spectroscopy/uv-vis-uv-vis-nir-spectroscopy/uv-vis-uv-vis-nir-systems/cary-60-uv-vis-spectrophotometer). UV-vis spectroscopy is very useful in determining the concentration of UV active compounds. 
# Both transition metals and organic compounds with conjugated $\pi$ systems will often be active in the UV-visible region of light. 
#

# ## 1.1 Principles of Colorimetry <a id="11-principles-of-colorimetry"></a>
# For example, The color of Allura Red solution is... red! Generally, the observed color is complementary to the color of light absorbed. In Figure 2, red is complementary to green. Thus, Allura Red absorbs primarily wavelengths in the 480-560 nm range. Wavelengths of 640-700 nm are not absorbed but transmitted, thus resulting in our perception of a red solution. 
# 
# <img src="images/light2.png" alt="light" width="300">
# 
# Take a look at the colour wheel of wavelengths of light corresponding to each color for transmission and absorbance. 
# In general the higher the concentration of the compound that is absorbing light, the greater the absoprtion at that frequency. We will be looking at peaks of absorptions measured in the lab for this session. 

# ## 1.2. Meet Rachel <a id="12-meet-rachel"></a>
# 
# Rachel is a final year student and as part of her final year project she needs to estimate the unknown concentration of the dye Rhodamine 6G in methanol, because she forgot to label one of her samples. Luckily she can use UV-Vis spectroscopy of Rhodamine in methanol and use Beer Lambert's law to estimate the concentration of the unlabelled sample. Her data can be found in the folder `data/Section4`. She has never tried this analysis in Python before, so rather than working straight on the actual dataset she wanted to try some parts of her analysis on different sets of data first. 
# 
# Can you help her fix her code and find the concentration of her unlabelled sample? 
# 
# <img src="images/Rachel.png" alt="Rachel" width="200">

# # Tasks 1 <a id="tasks-1"></a>

# In the directory `data/Section1` you find a file called `Rhodamine 6G in methanol .csv` Rachel collected in the lab to measure the absorbance of the dye Rhodamine 6G with respect to wavelength. 
# 
# This is what Rhodamine 6G looks like:

# ## 3. Find the unknown concentration of the compound based on Beer Lambert's Law 
# <a id="3-find-the-unknown-concentration-of-the-compound-based-on-beer-lamberts-law"></a>
# 
# In this section we will put some of the indidividual parts together of the previous sections to help identify Rachel the concentration of the sample series E she measured, but forgot to write down the concentration.
# 
# You will find her experimental absorbance data in `data/Section3`. For each concentration there are 3 measurements. There is a file called `data/Section3/concentrations.csv`, that tell you which sample had which concentration. For some reason sample `C` has noted down a concentration of `NaN`. You should be able to figure out the concentration at which the sample was measured though based on Beer Lambert's Law. You can use the data you have to create a calibration plot and make sure of the linearity of the Beer Lambert law. It stats that the absorption of light by a substance is proportional to its concentration in solution, or in equation format:
# 
# $$A = \epsilon l c,$$
# 
# where $A$ is the absorbance (unitless), $\epsilon$ is the molar absorptivity coefficient (M$^{-1}$cm$^{-1}$), $l$ is the pathlength of light through the cuvette (cm), and $c$ is the concentration (M).
# 
# A typical calibration curve will look like this:
# 
# 
# <img src="images/beer_law.png" alt="calibration" width="400">
# 
# In Rachel's case she has 4 repeat measurements of her absorbance with known concentration and 3 repeats of a measurements with unknown concentration. In this section you will reconstruct what the concentration of Rhodamine 6G was in sample `C`. 

# # Tasks 3 <a id="tasks-3"></a>

# </div>
# 
# - Write a function called `mean_absorbance` to easily loop over this. You should be able to reuse what you have done in [Section 2](#2-estimating-and-plotting-the-error-on-an-absorption-spectrum) and wrap this into a function.
# - Loop over all 5 data sets and compute mean absorbance and plot the absorbance v. wavelength (don't worry about error bars this time)

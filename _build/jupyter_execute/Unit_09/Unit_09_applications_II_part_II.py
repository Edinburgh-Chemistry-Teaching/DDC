# # 1. Working with protein crystals and molecular simulations
# <a id="1-working-with-protein-crystals-and-molecular-simulations"></a>
# 
# Proteins are polymers that are made up of 20 different amino acids. It is possible to crystalise proteins and then use X-rays to probe their structure. 
# 
# All structural data of proteins are collected in the [protein data bank](https://www.rcsb.org) (PDB). With over 180000 protein structures available. 3D structure data is invaluable for applications in many different areas of chemistry, as proteins underpin most vital functions in living organisms as natural catalysts. 
# 
# ## 1.1 PDB files <a id="11-pdb-files"></a>
# 
# To store information about proteins a fileformat called pdb was invented. It stores the names of the atoms in the protein, as well as the 3D coordinates that were determined from the crystal structure. Don't worry you will not need to interact much with these files. In Jupyter we can visualise protein structures from pdb files in different ways. In the following we will use `py3Dmol`.
# 
# Run the code cell below to see the first 20 lines of a pdb file:

# In[ ]:


get_ipython().system('head -n 20 data/Section4/1aki.pdb')


# As part of her final year project Rachel has been looking at the **hen egg white lysozyme** protein. She has been investigating the structure of it and has also run simulations to look at its stability over time. But she needs some help with analysing the simulations and understanding the data. 
# 
# Let's start by visualising the protein in the notebook:

# In[ ]:


# Install py3Dmol
get_ipython().system('pip install py3Dmol')


# In[ ]:


import py3Dmol
# This line will grab the pdb file from the data bank
view = py3Dmol.view(query="pdb:1aki") 
view.setStyle({"cartoon":{"color":"spectrum"}})
view.show()


# ## 1.2 Measuring properties from crystal structures <a id="12-measuring-properties-from-crystal-structures"></a>
# 
# It is possible to measure different properties from the X-ray structure data, such as `bond lengths`, `angles`, etc. You will try some of this as part of the assessment.

# ## 1.3 What are molecular dynamics simulations? <a id="13-what-are-molecular-dynamics-simulations"></a>
# Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are a way to understand how proteins behave inside cells, by using a computer to model this behaviour. Cells are crowded environments full of proteins and water. 
# 
# Take a look at this movie of a simulation of a bacterial cell. 

# <img src='data/Section4/crowded_cell.mp4'></img>

# In a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation we model atoms and bonds like balls and springs and generate so called trajectories over time using Newton's Laws of motion. 
# 
# Newton's second law is given by:
# 
# $$\mathbf{F} = \frac{d^2\mathbf{r}_i}{dt^2}$$
# 
# where $\mathbf{F}$ is the force on each atom $i$ and $\mathbf{r}_i$ is the position of atom $i$. The above equation is solved at every time step over a number of time steps, to calculate the position and velocity of each atom. 
# 
# To get started with an MD simulation you need some initial coordinates for a protein. These are often taken from the protein data bank. 
# 
# Here you see an example of a short trajectory of a single protein: lysozyme.
# 

# <img src='data/Section4/lys.gif' width='400'></img>

# # 2. Excursion into thermodynamics or how to check the equilibration of a simulation
# <a id="2-excursion-into-thermodynamics-or-how-to-check-the-equilibration-of-a-simulation"></a>
# 
# Molecular simulations are often run in similar conditions that mimic a lab environment, namely at **constant temperature**, **constant pressure**, and **constant number of particles** (NPT). To achieve this, the simulation needs to get a chance to equilibrate and some clever algorithmic tricks need to be done to achieve $N$ i.e. number of particles, $T$ temperature, and $p$ pressure to be constant. 
# 
# This can be done with pressure and temperature equilibrations. If you want to know more about the algorithms used in these equilibrations, see https://ftp.gromacs.org/pub/manual/manual-5.0.4.pdf.
# 
# The temperature equilibration step is called NVT, because the number of atoms $N$, volume $V$ and temperature $T$ are kept constant. Similarly, the pressure equilibration step is called NPT.
# 
# We will also plot the **running average** to see the equilibration better. The running average, denoted SMA for Simple Moving Average, is defined as 
# 
# $$ \mathrm{SMA} = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{i = n-k+1}^{n} p_i$$
# 
# where $p$ is a data point, $k$ is the window and $n$ is the total number of data points.

# * Plot the temperature against time.

# # 3. Assessing the stability of a protein in a simulation <a id="3-assessing-the-stability-of-a-protein-in-a-simulation"></a>
# 
# In this part we will consider the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) and the radius of gyration of the protein during the simulation. These two quantities are useful to judge if the protein maintains it shape, i.e. if the simulation is stable or the protein breaks apart. 
# 
# The root-mean square deviation is given by
# 
# $$\mathrm{RMSD} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=0}^{N} (v_i - w_i )^2}$$
# 
# where $v_i$ is the position of a reference structure and $w_i$ is the structure we're interested in.
# 
# The radius of gyration is a *measure of the compactness* of a protein, and is given by
# 
# $$R_\mathrm{g}(x) = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_i m_i r_i(y)^2 + m_ir_i(z)^2}{\sum_i m_i}}$$

Data-Driven Chemistry is a collection of learning material for an introductory Python course for undergraduate chemistry students. The presented material here serves as a public version of [Data-Driven Chemistry](http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/22-23/dpt/cxchem08031.htm) as taught at the University of Edinburgh in the School of Chemistry.

## Dependencies

This project uses the Python programming language, and requires Python >= 3.9.

Units are written and available as [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/).

Units will require different packages from the scientific Python ecosystem. The easiest way to install dependencies is using the Anaconda distribution, otherwise the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file also summarises the needed packages.

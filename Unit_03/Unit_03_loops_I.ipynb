    "By the end of this unit, you should be able to\n",
    "- use in-built functionality in python\n",
    "- import modules and libraries \n",
    "- use the `math` module to do some simple scientific computing tasks\n",
    "- developemore `pandas` skills to deal with large volumes of data\n",
    "- use logical operations to filter data\n",
    "- understand and use the different types of loops to do repetitive tasks including:\n",
    "    - `for`\n",
    "    - `if`\n",
    "    - `else`/`elif`\n",
    "    - `while`\n",
    "    - `break`\n",
    "- combine these tools to analyse data in a large file containing information about the periodic table\n",
    "- use tools from python to understand trends in the periodic table\n",

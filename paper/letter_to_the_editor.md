Dear Professor Barba and the rest of the editorial team,

Please find attached the submission "Course Materials for an Introduction to Data-Driven Chemistry" by James Cumby, Valentina Erastova, Matteo T. Degiacomi, J. Jasmin Güven, Claire L. Hobday, Antonia S.J.S. Mey, Hannah Pollak and Rafal Szabla, I wish to be considered for publication in JOSE.
The paper and its accompanying GitHub repository (https://github.com/Edinburgh-Chemistry-Teaching/Data-driven-chemistry) introduce course material on Data-driven Chemistry aimed at undergraduate chemistry students who are novices to Python programming.

The teaching material consists of 10 Units, covering the basics of programming, and topics around plotting and analysing data and conclude with a broad range of applications of the learned material to problems in Chemistry (e.g. UV-vis data or NMR data). The material is structured around Jupyter notebooks that are expected to be worked through by students ideally in a blended learning environment or in their own time.

The authors are unaware of such chemistry domain-specific available open-source material, which fills a gap in introductory domain-specific Python programming material. Therefore I believe this teaching material fits well within the remit of JOSE. Given the nature of the topic, I suggest Andrew McCluskey as the appropriate topic editor. I am looking forward to some feedback on the material provided and the accompanying manuscript.  

Kind regards,
Dr Antonia Mey
Chancellor's Fellow

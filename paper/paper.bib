  abstract = {The present manuscript intends to propose using the Google Colab platform to teach and solve physical chemistry problems using Python computational language. Seven Jupyter notebooks were written and made available for the students via Google Colab supplementary material of the physical chemistry course of the chemical engineering course of the Technological Faculty of the Rio de Janeiro State University. These notebooks include several problems extracted from the course bibliography and solved with the use of Python language. The scripts show how the students can perform linear and polynomial regressions, fit math models to given data, perform numerical integration and plot creation using Python and its standards libraries. The Colab platform was chosen because it is free to use, does not require the installation, setup, and configuration of Python packages and their libraries in the students' personal computers. It is a multiuser and collaborative environment, ideal for remote classes. The notebooks can be shared between instructor and students or between the students, which easy the communication and track of students' progress. Indeed, this resource can be useful even after the end of the pandemic. This manuscript describes the platform, its advantages, how it was applied in our physical chemistry course, and the students' feedback at the end of the term. All notebooks are available as Supplementary Material of the manuscript, translated from Portuguese to English since our course is entirely in Portuguese. I hope the material and experience shared in this manuscript can be helpful to chemistry instructors who intend to abroad their pedagogical methods to engage more students in the undergraduate courses.},

  abstract = {Employers of chemistry graduates are seeking a range of transferable skills from prospective employees, and academics are increasingly seeking to build employability skill development opportunities into the undergraduate curriculum. However, research suggests that undergraduates do not recognise or value such skill development without prompting. This recognition is essential if graduates are to be able to articulate their skills in the employment process. This study involves research amongst almost 1000 undergraduates studying chemistry at two institutions, using open-ended questions to collect qualitative data. The extent to which students recognised course-related skills development and understood the skills that employers are looking for was investigated, as was their desire to develop additional skills. Similarities and differences in student views between institutions are discussed, as well as trends across year levels and by gender. Results indicate that undergraduates studying chemistry are most likely to value and recognise development of some key skills sought by employers (teamwork, communication, thinking/problem solving, organisation/time management and laboratory/practical skills), but are very unlikely to value or recognise others (numeracy, independent learning, commercial awareness, interpersonal, research, computer/IT, creativity/innovation, flexibility/adaptability and initiative). Opportunities to develop the latter skills and recognition of the value of doing so will require improved communication with students and/or provision of new experiences within the curriculum.},

Moreover, while mathematics courses often focus on abstract problems, physical sciences, and particularly physical chemistry, offer concrete applications often with complicated functions. A one-semester course in ``Mathematics for Chemists'' offers a tailored syllabus specifically to address common challenges in physical and analytical courses. By including basic Python programming, students can focus on core concepts, rather than worry about common calculation or mathematical mistakes. The course includes an introduction to core Python concepts, including numpy, scipy, matplotlib, and sympy.

Therefore, it is a relevant skill to incorporate into the toolbox of any chemistry student. This work presents a workshop that introduces machine learning for chemistry students based on a set of Python notebooks and assignments. Python, one of the most popular programming languages, is open source, free to use, and has plenty of learning resources. The workshop is designed for students without previous experience in programming, and it aims for a deeper understanding of the complexity of concepts in programming and machine learning. The examples used correspond to real data from physicochemical characterizations of wine, a content that is of interest for students. The contents of the workshop are introduction to Python, basic statistics, data visualization, and dimension reduction, classification, and regression.},

  abstract = {For chemistry and biochemistry students to be successful in their future careers, they need high quality training not only in the technical skills of their STEM discipline but also many other non-technical skills important to being an effective scientist. In this chapter we define these non-technical skills as ``professional skills'' that include, but are not limited to, career skills (job searching, resume writing, networking, and having a professional mindset), scientific thinking (critical thinking, problem solving, and big picture thinking), scientific identity development, learning skills (self-regulated learning, initiative, study strategies, etc.), communication skills, and interpersonal skills such as teamwork and leadership development. Evidence from industry, government, and academia suggests that these professional skills are at least as, if not more important, than the STEM related technical skills in an undergraduate student's education. Though opportunities for professional development in these areas are available both through national scientific societies and at many institutions, problems with the current opportunities stem from the fact that, for various reasons, not all students engage with them. To address these problems, we recommend the development of instruction with three key features: professional skills are 1) integrated into the curriculum so that all students benefit; 2) scaffolded across courses whenever possible so that learning is intentionally connected and de-siloed; and 3) assessed using clearly articulated student learning outcomes. By creating professional skills curricula with these three features, chemistry and biochemistry programs will better prepare their students for the workforce and future careers.},
